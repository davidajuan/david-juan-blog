In the middle of March, my company gave the green light for almost every team member to start working remotely during the pandemic.  We were a few days ahead of almost every other large company in Detroit, so we were all trying to figure out what would become the new normal.  On a Thursday afternoon, my leader sent me an IM asking me to start thinking about what it would take to quickly build a landing page for the City of Detroit to use to schedule COVID-19 tests.  The team I lead at Quicken Loans is responsible for the digital storefront, which includes our highest trafficked landing pages.  

By that evening, I was on a call with the City of Detroit, and learned that what they needed was much more involved than a landing page.  The mayor of Detroit had brokered a deal with a lab in New Jersey that was willing to process 500 tests a day for city.  There was a catch:  the city had to figure out all of the logistics and technology on their own.  So that meant that the city had to figure out how to setup a drive through testing facility, collect patient data, schedule and onduct the test, transmit the data to multiple government agencies and the lab, and then route test results to patients.  Our CEO had already committed the support of Quicken Loans to the city, so in addition to my leader, our CIO, and myself, we also had people on the call from our Government Relations and Event Planning teams.  

We were all in to support, but our CIO wanted to make sure to level set on expectations.  He put it bluntly to the Mayor and his executive team:  What you're asking for is a year of work.  The response form the city:  Yes, and we need it in 10 days.  By the next morning, we were off to the races, and by Saturday morning, we would learn that situation in Detroit was dire.  Spending 10 days to build a years worth of software was a luxury that we could afford; we would have to go live by day 5.
