I recently had the incredible **privilege** of representing **Rocket Mortgage** at the world's largest Agile conference, **Agile2021**\! It was an unforgettable experience, made even more special as it coincided with the **20th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto**.

Though the conference was held virtually due to COVID restrictions, the energy and insights were just as powerful. It was a career highlight to be there alongside two fantastic colleagues: **David Negron** and the legendary **Jeff Sutherland**, who is, of course, the **co-inventor of Scrum**\!

Being able to document this moment, especially during such a significant anniversary for the Agile community, is something I'll cherish.

## Reflections on 20 Years of Agile

The evolution of Agile principles over the past two decades is truly inspiring. The core valuesâ€”**individuals and interactions over processes and tools**, **working software over comprehensive documentation**, **customer collaboration over contract negotiation**, and **responding to change over following a plan**â€”remain as vital today as they were in 2001. It's a testament to the framework that it continues to drive innovation and efficiency in our industry.

I'm looking forward to the next chapter of this journey\!
