The team I worked with at Rocket Mortgage to build the technology for Detroit's COVID-19 testing and vaccination initiatives met Governor Whitmer during the summer of this year. We did a show and tell of the tech we built and trained her how to use it. I'm so thankful that I had the chance to work on this initiative with these awesome people. Missing from the picture is Chris Raheb and David Negron.
