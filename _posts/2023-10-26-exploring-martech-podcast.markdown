I'm excited to share that I recently recorded my *first-ever* podcast episode!

A huge thanks to the host, **Bob Waltenspiel**, for having me on. He was a gracious host, especially for my first time on the mic!

We covered a lot of ground in the world of MarTech, including:
* Enterprise SEO
* User Experience (UX)
* The value of A/B Testing
* How I used these skills to get equity in a local start-up, Normal Coffee

My favorite part was diving into the big philosophical questions: "When do you know what is good? When do you know when it’s done?" We had a great discussion about the 'barometer' for quality and completion.

We also gave a shout-out to the incredible 900+ member Scrum Detroit Meetup community.

It was an honor to be on the show. I hope you enjoy the listen!
