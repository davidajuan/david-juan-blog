Last week I walked the stage and am now a proud graduate of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, with a Master of Science in Technology Management! Spending the day on campus with my wife, daughters, and dad is a memory that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I couldn’t have done this without their support, along with my team, professors, and company. 

I have to say that the benefits at Rocket Companies and Rocket Mortgage are incredible. Rocket fully funded my education (both my undergraduate and graduate degrees), adding to the already incredible learning and growth opportunities I have had within the company over the past 18 years.

I’m excited to apply some of the hypothesis testing, regression analysis, experimentation, and computer science knowledge that have I gained, but I’m even more excited to NEVER HAVE HOMEWORK AGAIN!
