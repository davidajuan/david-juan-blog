<img src="/assets/images/rkt-journey.png" alt="Highlights from my journey at Rocket" class="center">

In 2007, I walked into Quicken Loans to become a mortgage banker, a dream I decided to chase instead of finishing my business degree. Almost 19 years later, I’m leaving the company, now Rocket Mortgage, as an engineering leader with a lifetime of experiences and a heart full of gratitude.

My journey from banker to engineering leader only happened because of the path Rocket paved for me. After making it through the historic 2008 housing crisis, the company gave me a life-changing shot to join the technology team in 2012. After getting my feet wet as an individual contributor, I was trusted with my first leadership role and for the next 12 years, got to lead incredible teams through huge transformations in Agile, cloud, DevOps, digital, MarTech, data, and AI.

Rocket also invested so much in my growth, supporting me through both a bachelor's and master's degree and even sponsoring the research that got me published in a scientific journal at the University of Hawaii. For those kinds of opportunities that shaped my entire career, I'm just so incredibly grateful.

But what I'm most grateful for are the people. Over the past two decades, I've worked alongside some of the smartest, funniest, and most genuinely good people I have ever met. The relationships and connections I've built are ones I know will last a lifetime.

I am beyond excited for what’s next and will be sharing some big news on that front very soon. Stay tuned!
