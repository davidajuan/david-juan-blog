I just finished a fun little side project to keep my **static site generation** and **CI/CD** skills current (using a bunch of AI coding tools, of course!). I figured I'd share it because I think it’s a smart solution for maximizing your LinkedIn profile data.

I’m sure you’ve asked or answered this interview question at some point in your career: **“What would your team say about you?”**

Sure, you can say what you *think* they'd say, but if you’ve already collected a great stack of **LinkedIn Recommendations**, why not reference that objective, peer-validated feedback directly? It’s like having a 360-degree performance review ready to go, a genuinely **objective view of your leadership impact**.

## The Problem: LinkedIn Buries Your Best Feedback

The way LinkedIn displays recommendations is a major missed opportunity.

* It sorts by **most recent**.
* It only shows the **top two**.
* It hides everything else behind a tiny "**show more**" link.

When you’ve been around a while and have more than a few recommendations, almost nobody clicks through that wall of text. All that valuable career data is essentially **hidden**!

## The Solution: AI for Smarter Synthesis

While I was updating my personal website (and going deeper on AI coding tools), I decided to fix this.

1.  I added an **"About" section** to my site.
2.  I fed all my LinkedIn recommendations into **Gemini 2.5 Pro**.
3.  I had it summarize the feedback into **key themes**.
4.  I then organized those themes by **relationship type** (leader, partner, direct report, etc.).

It instantly turned a blob of individual recommendations into a concise, **data-backed snapshot** of my leadership style. I’m really happy with how it came out! For anyone who's hiring, this kind of thematic, easy-to-digest feedback is incredibly valuable.

## The Takeaway: Feature or Custom Solution?

This seems like such a necessary feature.

Do you think LinkedIn should build a feature to automatically summarize and theme your recommendations right into **LinkedIn Premium**? Or is a custom, external solution like this better for real **personalization**?
