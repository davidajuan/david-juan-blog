Hey! I'm David, an Engineering Leader based in Detroit.

I've been in the FinTech world since 2007, and I love the challenge of scaling engineering teams and building enterprise-scale digital platforms. My sweet spot is at the intersection of product, data, and customer experience.

Over the past 15+ years, Iâ€™ve had the chance to lead some amazing initiatives, like:
* Growing an engineering organization to 163 people across 19 teams.
* Driving a 721% increase in product feature delivery.
* Leading the digital experience for five Super Bowl campaigns.
* Building out Rocket's first Customer Data Platform (CDP), CMS, and Experimentation programs.

When I'm not diving into system architecture or mentoring engineers, I run the [Scrum Detroit](https://www.meetup.com/Scrum-Detroit/) user group, a community of 900+ product and engineering leaders.

### Outside of Work

Life isn't just about code and strategy. I love rock climbing, hunting, fishing, camping, and pretty much all things outdoors. I play guitar and the ukulele whenever I can and even won the Quicken Loans [Making The Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6ZV4m0NP-M) contest back in 2014.

I somehow convinced my beautiful wife Alicia to [marry me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKtDMy_Es2E) in 2010, and together we have two awesome girls, Sophia and Emma.

If you want the full professional rundown, you can learn more about my [experience here](/experience/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidajuan/).
