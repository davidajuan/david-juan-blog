### Outside of Work

Life isn't just about code and strategy. I love rock climbing, hunting, fishing, camping, and pretty much all things outdoors. I play guitar and the ukulele whenever I can and even won the Quicken Loans [Making The Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6ZV4m0NP-M) contest back in 2014.

I somehow convinced my beautiful wife Alicia to [marry me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKtDMy_Es2E) in 2010, and together we have two awesome girls, Sophia and Emma.
